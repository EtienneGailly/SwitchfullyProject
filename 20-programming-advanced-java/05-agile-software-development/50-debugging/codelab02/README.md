Thanks for the help in the previous codelab01! ...maybe we could hang out after work? ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
I've gotten a bit farther in the meantime: I've added a AdditionalToppings class (which by default are all false: see the factory method!).
I've also added a test, but it doesn't seem to want to succeed!! Can you help me?
There might be more than just one bug in the code...
