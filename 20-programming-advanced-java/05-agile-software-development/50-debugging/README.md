# Debugging
Help! My tests are not green! Can you help me fix them? 
There is no time to explain the application, but maybe if you use your knowledge of debugging you can figure it out?
Run the tests/a test in debug mode. Don't worry if you're not familiar with Spring or the other libraries in this 
project: you should still be able to find what's wrong!
Good luck! ðŸ˜˜
