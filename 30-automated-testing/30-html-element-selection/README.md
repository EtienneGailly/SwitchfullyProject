# HTML Element Selection

The goal of this chapter is to learn how to select elements in a html page.

For this we have the training page that can be found in the training-page folder or at the [online page](https://training.switchfully.com/track/testing/training-page/selecting-elements.html).

## Context
When using Selenium you'll need to select elements on html pages. The 3 most popular ways to do this are:
- based on id
- with css selectors
- with xpath selectors
