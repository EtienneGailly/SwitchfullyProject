# FINAL PROJECT

As your final project, we have selected a project the JAVA class is currently working on.

The project is a learning management system with no automated testing whatsoever at this moment.

Your job is to write as many automated tests as possible over the next two days.

You will work in teams of four. Two people can work on separate functionalities. You'll have to communicate to avoid double work.

Start off by analyzing the stories in this project. You can find them at the [Project homepage on GIT](https://github.com/switchfully/track-shared/tree/master/60-projects/40-final-project/10-LMS).

Compare the stories to what is already implemented (it's a work in progress, not everything has been developed). You can find the app at [this address](https://switchfully-testing-lms.netlify.app/).

After analyzing, you can start writing your tests. Make clear and good feature files for the stories you want to test and integrate them into the project using Cucumber. Use the code you wrote during previous lessons as a reference. Don't forget about dependencies and such, this is still an empty codelab for now.

If you fancy a challenge, you are free to fork the project and write your tests in there. You'll have to spend time to understand the structure and get it working. This might cause unforeseen issues. You can find the project at its [Github repo](https://github.com/switchfully/LMS-trapezium-backend). If this poses too many problems (which is fine), you can just write the tests in this codelab.
